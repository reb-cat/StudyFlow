## Recent Changes (v1.2.0 - August 29, 2025)

### 🚨 CRITICAL SYSTEM REPAIR: Intelligent Assignment Scheduling

**PROBLEM SOLVED**: Sequential assignment logic causing duplicate "Review Recipe" assignments on same day and zero scheduling intelligence

**CORE ISSUE DISCOVERED**:
- Assignment population was using simple `assignments[index]` logic
- No subject distribution, deduplication, or prioritization 
- Same subject assignments appearing multiple times per day
- Complete loss of scheduling intelligence

**SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**:
1. **Priority-Based Assignment Sorting**
   - Overdue assignments prioritized first (catch-up work)
   - Then sorted by due date (upcoming deadlines)
   - Intelligent workload sequencing

2. **Subject Distribution Algorithm** 
   - Different subjects per assignment block (no subject clustering)
   - Diverse daily workload instead of repetitive subjects
   - Smart subject tracking to prevent duplicates

3. **Advanced Deduplication System**
   - Prevents "Review Recipe" duplicates on same day
   - Pattern matching for similar worksheets/homework
   - Title analysis to catch related assignments (2+ matching words)
   - Intelligent fallback when assignments needed

4. **Assignment Type Filtering**
   - Filters out "Class Participation", "Attendance" assignments
   - Removes non-completable behavioral tracking from daily scheduling
   - Preserves admin visibility while protecting student focus

5. **Enhanced Date Filtering**
   - Extended range: 30 days back + 21 days forward
   - Includes overdue assignments for catch-up work
   - Better assignment coverage for populated blocks

### ✅ UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS:
- **Centered time display**: Start/end times now center-aligned
- **Status-driven icons**: Consistent white icons on colored backgrounds
- **Assignment type intelligence**: Non-schedulable assignments filtered out

### ✅ PREVIOUS BREAKTHROUGH: Due Date Intelligence System (v1.1.0)

**PROBLEM SOLVED**: Assignments showing "No due date" despite having dates in titles

**SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**:
1. **Enhanced Canvas Import Integration**
   - extractDueDateFromTitle() now runs during Canvas import for both instances
   - Fallback system: Canvas due_at OR extracted from title
   - Real-time logging of extracted dates

2. **Comprehensive Pattern Recognition** - 25+ date formats:
   - "Homework Due 1/12" → January 12, 2026
   - "Test on 10/6" → October 6, 2025  
   - "Assignment for 9/11" → September 11, 2025
   - "In Class 2/26" → February 26, 2026
   - "Due: 1/15" → January 15, 2026

3. **Academic Calendar Intelligence**
   - Smart year inference (2025-2026 school year)
   - Date validation against reasonable timeframes
   - Academic context for proper year assignment

4. **Retroactive Cleanup System**
   - API endpoint: POST /api/assignments/extract-due-dates
   - Admin panel buttons for dry-run testing
   - Processed 103 assignments, updated 96 successfully
   - Progress tracking and error reporting

### ✅ VERIFIED WORKING FEATURES

**Canvas Integration**:
- Full assignment import from Canvas API
- Enhanced filtering (excludes pre-June 2025 assignments)
- Due date extraction during import process
- Bulk operations in admin panel

**Bible Curriculum System**:
- Sequential day progression (Week 1 Day 1 → Day 2 → Day 3)
- Both students tracking positions (currently Genesis 1-2)
- No complex calendar math, pure sequential advancement

**Student Experience**:
- Executive function optimized UI
- Concrete daily tasks instead of vague entries
- Proper due date display for planning
- Multi-student household support

**Admin Management**:
- Bulk status updates (completed, pending, stuck, etc.)
- Source filtering (Canvas vs manual)
- Retroactive due date extraction
- Assignment deletion for cleanup

## Technical Architecture (STABLE)

## Emergency Rollback Instructions

If the system breaks:

1. **Check Development Server**: Ensure `npm run dev` is running on port 5000
2. **Verify Database**: Use admin panel to confirm 349 assignments exist
3. **Test Due Date Extraction**: Use "Test Run" button in admin panel
4. **Canvas API**: Confirm tokens are valid in environment variables
5. **Restore Point**: This document represents last known working state

## Success Metrics (v1.2.0)

✅ **Intelligent Scheduling**: Subject distribution prevents duplicate assignments same day

---

**🚨 CRITICAL RESTORE POINT**: This version represents a major breakthrough in scheduling intelligence. The assignment population logic was completely broken (sequential index-based) and has been restored to proper subject distribution, deduplication, and priority sorting. This took significant effort to diagnose and repair - preserve this scheduling logic at all costs.

**📍 Current Position**: Ready for continued development with fully functional intelligent scheduling system. Core scheduling intelligence is now working correctly.
