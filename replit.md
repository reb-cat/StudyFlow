StudyFlow is a full-stack web application designed to help students manage academic workloads. It transforms generic schedule entries into specific daily tasks, supporting executive function needs. The platform integrates with Canvas and uses PostgreSQL for data persistence. Its core purpose is to provide a compassionate and supportive approach to productivity, offering concrete daily tasks and a sequential 52-week curriculum progression.

*   **Canvas Integration**: Full assignment import, enhanced filtering (excludes pre-June 2025 assignments), and due date extraction during import.
*   **Bible Curriculum System**: Manages sequential day progression (e.g., Week 1 Day 1 -> Day 2).
*   **Admin Management**: Provides bulk status updates, source filtering, retroactive due date extraction, and assignment deletion.
*   **Dark Mode Theme System**: Comprehensive theme switching with proper 4.5:1 contrast ratios, comfortable eye-strain-reducing color palettes, and device theme preference support.
*   **Instruction-Free Interface**: Clean, focused UI that displays only essential information (titles, subjects, due dates, completion status) without instructional clutter.
*   **UI/UX**: Features centered time display, status-driven icons, and an executive function-optimized interface focusing on concrete daily tasks.

## External Dependencies
