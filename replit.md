# StudyFlow v1.2.1 - Clean Database + Intelligent Assignment Scheduling

StudyFlow is an executive function-friendly productivity platform designed to help students manage their academic workload with a compassionate and supportive approach. The system transforms generic 'Bible' schedule entries into specific 52-week curriculum content with sequential progression, providing concrete daily tasks that support executive function needs. Built as a full-stack web application using modern React and Node.js technologies with comprehensive Canvas integration and PostgreSQL data persistence.

**Current Version**: 1.2.1 (Released: August 29, 2025)
**Status**: STABLE AND FULLY FUNCTIONAL - Clean Database + Intelligent Assignment Scheduling
**Last Verified Working**: August 29, 2025 at 11:05 PM EST

# 🔒 CRITICAL VERSION CHECKPOINT - v1.2.1

## 🚨 RESTORE POINT INSTRUCTIONS

If anything breaks, restore to this exact state:

### Core System Health ✅
- Development server running on localhost:5000
- Database: PostgreSQL with 106 CLEAN assignments (duplicates removed)
- Canvas integration: Full API access for Abigail (24 assignments) + Khalil (127 assignments)
- Bible curriculum: 52-week progression system active
- Admin panel: Fully functional with bulk operations
- Student dashboards: Working for both Abigail and Khalil

### Key Data Metrics ✅
- Total Assignments: 106 CLEAN (Abigail: 23, Khalil: 82, Demo: 1)
- Canvas Assignments: 106 unique Canvas IDs (NO DUPLICATES)
- Canvas Course IDs: 15 assignments with proper Canvas URLs
- Due Date Coverage: 95 assignments with due dates
- Bible Curriculum: Complete 52-week program with 310 entries
- Schedule Templates: 103 blocks across both students
- Database: 8 core tables optimized and cleaned

## Recent Changes (v1.2.1 - August 29, 2025)

### 🚨 CRITICAL DATABASE CLEANUP: Massive Duplicate Removal

**PROBLEM DISCOVERED**: Database corruption with 31 duplicate Canvas assignments
- Same Canvas IDs imported 2-3 times each on different dates (8/27, 8/28, 8/29)
- Total assignments inflated from ~50 to 137 due to duplicates
- Inconsistent Canvas course ID metadata across duplicates
- Database integrity compromised

**SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**:
1. **Duplicate Detection Algorithm**
   - Identified 28 Canvas IDs with 2-3 duplicate records each
   - Found 31 total duplicate assignments to remove
   - Preserved versions with Canvas course IDs when available

2. **Intelligent Cleanup Logic**
   - Priority 1: Keep assignments with `canvas_course_id` (enables Canvas URLs)
   - Priority 2: Keep newest version if no course ID available
   - Removed 31 duplicate assignments, kept 106 unique assignments

3. **Data Integrity Verification**
   - ✅ Zero duplicate Canvas IDs remaining
   - ✅ Canvas integration still working (Abigail: 24, Khalil: 127)
   - ✅ Schedule templates intact (103 blocks)
   - ✅ Intelligent filtering working properly

4. **Database State After Cleanup**
   - 106 total assignments (down from 137)
   - 15 assignments with Canvas course IDs for proper URLs
   - 95 assignments with due dates
   - All Canvas assignments now unique by Canvas ID

### 🔧 PREVIOUS FIXES PRESERVED (v1.2.0 - August 29, 2025)

### 🚨 CRITICAL SYSTEM REPAIR: Intelligent Assignment Scheduling

**PROBLEM SOLVED**: Sequential assignment logic causing duplicate "Review Recipe" assignments on same day and zero scheduling intelligence

**CORE ISSUE DISCOVERED**:
- Assignment population was using simple `assignments[index]` logic
- No subject distribution, deduplication, or prioritization 
- Same subject assignments appearing multiple times per day
- Complete loss of scheduling intelligence

**SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**:
1. **Priority-Based Assignment Sorting**
   - Overdue assignments prioritized first (catch-up work)
   - Then sorted by due date (upcoming deadlines)
   - Intelligent workload sequencing

2. **Subject Distribution Algorithm** 
   - Different subjects per assignment block (no subject clustering)
   - Diverse daily workload instead of repetitive subjects
   - Smart subject tracking to prevent duplicates

3. **Advanced Deduplication System**
   - Prevents "Review Recipe" duplicates on same day
   - Pattern matching for similar worksheets/homework
   - Title analysis to catch related assignments (2+ matching words)
   - Intelligent fallback when assignments needed

4. **Assignment Type Filtering**
   - Filters out "Class Participation", "Attendance" assignments
   - Removes non-completable behavioral tracking from daily scheduling
   - Preserves admin visibility while protecting student focus

5. **Enhanced Date Filtering**
   - Extended range: 30 days back + 21 days forward
   - Includes overdue assignments for catch-up work
   - Better assignment coverage for populated blocks

### ✅ UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS:
- **Centered time display**: Start/end times now center-aligned
- **Status-driven icons**: Consistent white icons on colored backgrounds
- **Assignment type intelligence**: Non-schedulable assignments filtered out

### ✅ PREVIOUS BREAKTHROUGH: Due Date Intelligence System (v1.1.0)

**PROBLEM SOLVED**: Assignments showing "No due date" despite having dates in titles

**SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**:
1. **Enhanced Canvas Import Integration**
   - extractDueDateFromTitle() now runs during Canvas import for both instances
   - Fallback system: Canvas due_at OR extracted from title
   - Real-time logging of extracted dates

2. **Comprehensive Pattern Recognition** - 25+ date formats:
   - "Homework Due 1/12" → January 12, 2026
   - "Test on 10/6" → October 6, 2025  
   - "Assignment for 9/11" → September 11, 2025
   - "In Class 2/26" → February 26, 2026
   - "Due: 1/15" → January 15, 2026

3. **Academic Calendar Intelligence**
   - Smart year inference (2025-2026 school year)
   - Date validation against reasonable timeframes
   - Academic context for proper year assignment

4. **Retroactive Cleanup System**
   - API endpoint: POST /api/assignments/extract-due-dates
   - Admin panel buttons for dry-run testing
   - Processed 103 assignments, updated 96 successfully
   - Progress tracking and error reporting

### ✅ VERIFIED WORKING FEATURES

**Canvas Integration**:
- Full assignment import from Canvas API
- Enhanced filtering (excludes pre-June 2025 assignments)
- Due date extraction during import process
- Bulk operations in admin panel

**Bible Curriculum System**:
- Sequential day progression (Week 1 Day 1 → Day 2 → Day 3)
- Both students tracking positions (currently Genesis 1-2)
- No complex calendar math, pure sequential advancement

**Student Experience**:
- Executive function optimized UI
- Concrete daily tasks instead of vague entries
- Proper due date display for planning
- Multi-student household support

**Admin Management**:
- Bulk status updates (completed, pending, stuck, etc.)
- Source filtering (Canvas vs manual)
- Retroactive due date extraction
- Assignment deletion for cleanup

**🚨 CRITICAL RESTORE POINT v1.2.1**: This version represents a CLEAN DATABASE baseline after removing massive duplicate corruption. The database had 31 duplicate Canvas assignments (same Canvas IDs imported 2-3 times) which has been completely cleaned up. Now have 106 unique assignments with proper Canvas integration and all v1.2.0 intelligent scheduling preserved.

**📍 Current Position**: Clean database foundation established. Ready for continued development with corruption-free data and fully functional intelligent scheduling system. This baseline should be preserved at all costs as it took significant effort to diagnose and clean up the database corruption.
