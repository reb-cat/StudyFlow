The best practices for dark mode feature sets focus on **accessibility**, **contrast**, and informed design choices that enhance usability for all users. A well-designed dark mode should never compromise core usability and should be tested across devices and environments for clarity and comfort.[1][2][3]

## Key Dark Mode Principles

- **Avoid pure black and pure white:** Use dark gray shades (like #121212) instead of pure black for backgrounds to reduce eye strain and soften contrast.[4][2]
- **Strengthen contrast:** Ensure interactive elements (such as buttons and links) have contrast ratios of at least 4.5:1 to ensure readability and focus.[2]
- **Adapt colors and avoid saturation:** Desaturate bright, intense (“neon”) colors since they can be visually distracting or hard to read in dark mode.[5][6][2]
- **Typography clarity:** Use sans-serif fonts, and larger, bolder text for legibility on dark backgrounds.[2]
- **Communicate depth without shadows:** Traditional shadows don’t work well in dark themes; use lighter surfaces, negative space, and controlled contrast for elevation cues instead of black shadows.[6][7][1]
- **Preserve brand identity wisely:** Adapt brand colors to maintain personality, but don’t simply invert the palette; strategic use of key colors is best.[7][6]

## Accessibility Considerations

- **Respect system settings:** Mirror the device’s operating system preference for dark mode to avoid user confusion or extra configuration.[3][1]
- **Allow user choice:** Enable users to switch between modes independently, as some may find dark mode less accessible.[8]
- **Test for color blindness and low vision:** Validate the design using accessibility tools and user feedback, ensuring vital elements stand out.[8][2]
- **Transparent images and graphics:** Use formats like SVG or PNG to avoid backgrounds that may become invisible in dark mode.[1]

## Practical Recommendations

- **Test in real environments:** Simulate low-light and glare conditions during QA to catch potential issues before release.[2]
- **Check all UI elements and emails:** Review how everything — from overlays to text — renders in dark mode, including outside the app (emails, notifications).[1]
- **Avoid pure color inversions:** Rather than simply swapping colors, thoughtfully redesign elements for the dark palette to maintain meaning and usability.[6][7]
- **Negative space is critical:** Simplify layouts to ensure clarity and scalability in dark mode.[6]
