StudyFlow v1.1.0 - Enhanced Due Date Intelligence
StudyFlow is an executive function-friendly productivity platform designed to help students manage their academic workload with a compassionate and supportive approach. The system transforms generic 'Bible' schedule entries into specific 52-week curriculum content with sequential progression, providing concrete daily tasks that support executive function needs. Built as a full-stack web application using modern React and Node.js technologies with comprehensive Canvas integration and PostgreSQL data persistence.
