🔍 Complete Analysis: Missing Information & Database Mismatches
🚨 Critical Database Mismatches
1. Missing Database Tables:
* ❌ sessions table: Complete absence - explains authentication type errors
* Code expects: req.session.authenticated
* Reality: No sessions table exists
2. Missing Database Fields:
* ❌ deleted_at: Commented out in schema but code tries to use it
* ❌ canvas_grade_status: Commented out but needed for sync
* ✅ updated_at: Exists but causing type conflicts
🔧 Interface Implementation Gaps
Missing from IStorage Interface:
// Exists in implementation but missing from interface:
autoScheduleAssignmentsForDate(studentName: string, targetDate: string): Promise<{...}>

Incomplete Implementations:
* getAllAssignments(includeDeleted): Parameter unused
* getBibleCurrentWeek(): Hardcoded to week 1 with TODO
⚠️ Type Safety Issues
Session Authentication:
// Code expects this but type doesn't include it:
req.session.authenticated = true // ❌ Property doesn't exist

Canvas Assignment Types:
* published property: Exists in interface but LSP says missing
* missing property: Code expects but type doesn't have it
Update Types:
// These cause type errors:
{ updatedAt: new Date() } // ❌ Not in UpdateAssignment type

📝 TODO/FIXME Accumulation
Critical TODOs:
1. Soft deletion: deletedAt field commented out but sync expects it
2. Canvas sync fields: Multiple fields waiting for "deployment"
3. Bible curriculum: Week calculation hardcoded
4. Schema push: Multiple references to "after schema is pushed"
💡 Impact Assessment
High Priority (Production Blockers):
* Sessions table missing → Authentication broken
* Schema/database field mismatches → Runtime errors
Medium Priority (Type Safety):
* Interface gaps → Development inconsistencies
* Missing type properties → TypeScript errors
Low Priority (Tech Debt):
* TODO accumulation → Future maintenance burden
* Hardcoded values → Limited functionality
This analysis shows the codebase has several layers of incomplete features and database mismatches that could cause production issues beyond the assignment completion sync we just fixed.
