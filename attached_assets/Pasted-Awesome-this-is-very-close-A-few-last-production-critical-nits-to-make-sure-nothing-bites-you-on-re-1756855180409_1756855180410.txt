Awesomeâ€”this is very close. A few last production-critical nits to make sure nothing bites you on redeploy:

0) Tiny but important corrections
	â€¢	NODE_ENV in Secrets: Safe to keep, but your app logic shouldnâ€™t depend on it. Youâ€™ve already got explicit flags (cookies, CORS, etc.), which is good.
	â€¢	db:push vs your ORM:
	â€¢	If youâ€™re using Drizzle, the command is typically drizzle-kit migrate (or your custom script), not db:push.
	â€¢	db:push is Prisma-style. Make sure the migration command matches your actual tool so prod schema definitely applies.
	â€¢	secure: true cookies: Replitâ€™s hosted URL is HTTPS, so this is fine. In local prod tests (http), temporarily set COOKIE_SECURE=false or your cookie wonâ€™t set.
	â€¢	Monolith only: sameSite: 'lax' works. If you ever split frontend/API across domains, switch to sameSite: 'none' + keep secure: true.

1) Final file/command snapshot (Option B)
	â€¢	.replit

run = "bash -lc 'npm ci && npm --prefix client run build && npm run start'"


	â€¢	package.json (root)

{
  "scripts": {
    "build:client": "npm --prefix client run build",
    "build:server": "tsc -p tsconfig.server.json",
    "build": "npm run build:client && npm run build:server",
    "start": "node dist/server/index.js",
    "migrate": "drizzle-kit migrate"   // or your exact migration cmd
  }
}

(Swap migrate to your real migration command if different.)

2) Secrets to set on Replit (monolith)

APP_ENV=production              # optional but explicit
NODE_ENV=production             # ok to keep
DATABASE_URL=postgres://...
SESSION_SECRET=<long-random>
COOKIE_SECURE=true
COOKIE_SAMESITE=lax
FAMILY_PASSWORD=<only if used>
# Canvas/Email/etc tokens as needed

Do not set PORT (Replit injects it).

3) Zero-guess smoke test (2â€“3 minutes)

In the Replit console after clicking Run:
	1.	Server bind: you should see a log like listening on <PORT> and host 0.0.0.0.
	2.	Migrate: run your real migration command (e.g., npm run migrate). Confirm tables exist (no-op if already migrated).
	3.	Auth cookie: open app, sign up, check DevTools â†’ Application â†’ Cookies; a cookie like sf_session appears, Path /, Secure, SameSite Lax.
	4.	Data flow: create Course + Task â†’ refresh â†’ still there.
	5.	Isolation: create a second user â†’ sees only their own stuff.
	6.	SPA fallback: hit a deep link (e.g., /courses/123) â†’ reload â†’ still serves the app (no 404 from server).

4) Post-deploy guardrails (prevent regressions)
	â€¢	Keep /api/* routes before static + SPA fallback.
	â€¢	Never reintroduce vite dev/nodemon/ts-node into the start path.
	â€¢	No localhost in codeâ€”client uses VITE_API_URL (empty for same-origin).
	â€¢	Leave a one-liner migration command you can run anytime.

If your migrations tool is indeed Drizzle and not Prisma, swap that db:push line to your actual drizzle-kit migrate (or your wrapper). With that aligned, youâ€™re setâ€”ship it. ðŸš€
