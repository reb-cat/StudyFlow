Goal: For a specific student/date, print a full decision trace of (a) how the day/template is chosen and (b) why each assignment was or wasn’t placed into a block, and (c) where the UI’s “Today” date is sourced.

A) CLI diagnosis (same engine as the probe)
	•	Create a dev-only CLI command (reuse your probe internals, no web/auth) that accepts:
--student Abigail --date 2025-09-02 (and also run for 2025-09-03).
	•	Before scheduling, print a Day Header:
	•	School Timezone, Input date,
	•	Weekday in School TZ (name & number),
	•	Weekday used to select blocks (and the source function name),
	•	Template chosen (Home vs Co-op) and why (e.g., study hall blocks present).
	•	Print Block Inventory actually considered:
	•	Count + list of assignmentBlocks (blockNumber, start, end).
	•	Count + list of studyHallBlocks (blockNumber, start, end).
	•	Print Assignment Pipeline (counts at each stage):
	•	Total assignments fetched → filtered to “unscheduled/pending” → filtered by availability/date window → final candidates.
	•	For each assignment considered, emit a one-line decision with a tag:
	•	PLACED block=<n> reason=<Priority/Location/Etc>
	•	or SKIPPED reason=<NoBlocksLeft|AvailabilityOutsideDay|DueAfterPolicy|AlreadyScheduled|NonSchedulable|PortabilityConflict|Unknown>
	•	Print a Summary: PLACED=<x> SKIPPED=<y> OPEN_BLOCKS_UNUSED=<z>.

B) Frontend “Today” source (trace only; don’t change code)
	•	Locate the exact place the “Today” label/default date is computed for the schedule page.
	•	Print the function name/file used for “today” and the raw value it returns at render time.
	•	Confirm whether it uses the School Timezone helper you added, or an older pattern like toISOString().split('T')[0] / new Date() without timezone.
	•	If multiple sources exist (client default vs server fallback), print both.

Run & report (both dates):
	1.	--date 2025-09-02
	2.	--date 2025-09-03
Paste the full Day Header, Block Inventory, first 5 assignment decisions, and the Summary for each run.
Then paste the “Today source” trace (file/function + returned value).
