Phase A — Fix routing (must happen first)
	1.	Mount the API router before the React “catch-all” route in production.
	2.	Re-deploy once.
	3.	Proof required (screenshots):
	•	Hitting /api/__nope__ on prod returns a JSON 404 (not HTML).
	•	A normal planner API (e.g., /api/schedule/Abigail/<date>) returns JSON.

Phase B — Re-prove authentication in prod
	4.	Capture the login response headers on prod showing:
Set-Cookie: connect.sid=…; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=None; Path=/.
	5.	Show Application → Cookies for https://study-flow.replit.app with that cookie present.
	6.	Show /api/me on prod returning the authenticated user.

Phase C — Fix data parity (no fabricating blocks)
	7.	Do not “sync” or “clean” dev. Instead:
	•	Export a read-only list of Thursday template blocks for Abigail from Dev and Prod (start/end, subject, block type).
	•	Confirm IDs and names for courses/subjects match between envs (or provide a mapping).
	8.	Prepare a one-time import plan from Dev → Prod for the 10 real template blocks, with these guardrails:
	•	Take a backup snapshot of Prod before any change.
	•	Import only the missing Thursday blocks for Abigail; do not touch existing assignments or logs.
	•	After import, the count must equal 10 and block times/subjects must match the Dev list exactly.

Phase D — Add planner guardrails (so this can’t regress)
	9.	On planner initialization in prod, log a single line with counts:
tasks_total, due_today, filtered, scheduled, template_block_count, coop_day.
	10.	Add a safety check: if template_block_count < 6, return a clear JSON error (e.g., “Template incomplete for this day”) instead of silently scheduling into placeholders.

Phase E — Acceptance pack (attach all from prod)
	•	Router proof: /api/__nope__ → JSON 404.
	•	Login Set-Cookie screenshot + Cookies panel.
	•	/api/me JSON.
	•	Template before/after counts for Abigail Thursday (Dev=10, Prod=10), with the list of blocks (start–end–subject–type).
	•	Planner re-test HAR:
	•	POST /initialize returns success,
	•	GET /schedule/<date> returns non-empty items that correspond to real blocks, not placeholders.
	•	One planner log line showing counts (including template_block_count=10).
