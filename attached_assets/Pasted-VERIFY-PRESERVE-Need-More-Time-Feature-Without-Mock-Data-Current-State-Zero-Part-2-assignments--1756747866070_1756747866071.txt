VERIFY & PRESERVE "Need More Time" Feature Without Mock Data
Current State: Zero Part 2 assignments exist (correct - students haven't used app yet)
Required State: Feature must be ready to work when students need it
Part 1: Locate the Need More Time Feature Code
Search for the actual feature implementation:
- Search for: "need more time", "needMoreTime", "split", "part 2", "extend deadline"
- Check student-dashboard.tsx for UI buttons/options
- Look in server/routes.ts for endpoints handling assignment splitting
- Find any database schema supporting parent/child assignment relationships
Part 2: Document How It's Supposed to Work
Based on code found, document:

How does a student trigger "Need More Time"?
What happens to the original assignment?
How is the Part 2 assignment created?
What fields link them together?
How are both parts displayed in the UI?

Part 3: Test the Feature Without Creating Mock Data
Using a REAL assignment from the database:

Log in as a student (or student view)
Find the "Need More Time" option on an assignment
Trigger it and observe what happens
Verify a legitimate Part 2 is created with:

Parent assignment reference
Proper Canvas ID inheritance
Correct due date extension
Original marked as "needs review" or similar



Part 4: Ensure Feature Survived Cleanup
Verify these components still exist:

UI button/trigger for Need More Time
Backend endpoint to handle the split
Database logic to create Part 2
Display logic to show both parts
Completion tracking for multi-part assignments

Part 5: Add Safeguards Against Future Confusion
If feature exists, add clear markers:
javascript// When creating legitimate Part 2:
{
  title: originalTitle + " (Part 2)",
  parentAssignmentId: originalId,  // Critical marker
  createdVia: "student_need_more_time",  // Not "mock_data"
  splitDate: new Date(),
  originalDueDate: assignment.dueDate,
  extendedDueDate: newDueDate
}
Part 6: If Feature Is Missing
If the cleanup removed it, restore ONLY the legitimate splitting logic:

Add endpoint: POST /api/assignments/:id/need-more-time
Add UI button in student view only
Ensure it requires authenticated student session
Log the action for audit trail

Expected Findings:

Location of Need More Time feature (file:line)
Whether it survived the cleanup
How to trigger it properly
Safeguards to prevent it being confused with mock data

Critical: Do NOT create any test Part 2 assignments. Just verify the feature exists and will work when students actually need it.
