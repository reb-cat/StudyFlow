Task: Minimal “UTC hardening” patch in the scheduler (limited scope).
Goal: Stop local-time parsing from shifting blocks by DST/travel. Keep display unchanged.

Scope (only these callsites):
	1.	server/lib/assignmentIntelligence.ts lines near 558–560 (date-only parsing + start/end-of-day).
	2.	server/storage.ts lines near 1384–1387 (date-only parsing + local start-of-day).

What to implement (behavior, not code):
	•	When a date comes in as a date-only string like YYYY-MM-DD, interpret it as UTC midnight of that date, not local time.
	•	Compute start of day and end of day in UTC (00:00:00.000Z to 23:59:59.999Z).
	•	For any “combine date + time” operation (e.g., 2025-09-02 + 09:00), construct the timestamp as that date/time in UTC, not local time.
	•	Do not change any client/UI formatting; the API should still return ISO strings.
	•	Do not change any other files/lines outside the scope above.

Instrumented validation (keep logs temporary):
	•	Add SCHED: logs around those two spots to print, for one example date:
	•	input date string, computed UTC start/end of day (ISO), and first 2 generated blocks {start,end,durationMin} as ISO.
	•	Keep existing SCHED: logs you already added elsewhere.

Acceptance checks (please run & report):
	1.	Probe: Hit one schedule day that looked “off” before (same student/date). Capture the SCHED: logs before and after the change for those two spots (Replit can snapshot logs).
	2.	Offset check: For one block, confirm: server SCHED start ISO == API JSON start (string match).
	3.	Display check: In the browser, note the on-screen time for that block and the client’s timezone from the console; confirm the hour difference equals the expected UTC offset (e.g., UTC→EDT = −4h).
	4.	Regression guard: Add 2 tiny checks (existing test setup, no new libs):
	•	Given date-only 2025-09-02 and 09:00–10:00, resulting ISO should be 2025-09-02T09:00:00Z..10:00:00Z.
	•	End-of-day boundary on same date should cap at 23:59:59.999Z.

Constraints:
	•	No new dependencies.
	•	Keep changes minimal and localized to the lines listed.
	•	Do not alter DB, routes, or client display code.
