LOCKDOWN FORENSIC MODE (DETERMINISTIC, READ-ONLY)

Hard rules (must follow exactly):
- NO CODE CHANGES. NO DB WRITES. NO SEEDS. NO ‚ÄúQUICK FIXES.‚Äù 
- Return evidence only. If a mutation is attempted, STOP and report violation.
- Use the exact scope: Student=Khalil, Date=2025-09-05 (Friday). Do not query other dates.
- Print the code build hash and env toggles so results are comparable run-to-run.

Preamble ‚Äî print these identifiers first:
1) CODE: repo commit SHA (or file checksums for server/lib/assignmentIntelligence.ts, server/storage.ts, client/student-dashboard.tsx).
2) ENV SNAPSHOT: values of RUN_SEEDS, NODE_ENV/REPLIT_DEPLOYMENT, DATABASE_URL host (redact creds), TZ.
3) DB SNAPSHOT: database name + server version.
4) TIME BASIS: ‚ÄúNow‚Äù (UTC) and the date used for all queries (must be 2025-09-05).

Phase A ‚Äî DB truth (READ-ONLY, exact queries; include row counts):
A1) Pending due ‚â§ 2025-09-08 23:59 for Khalil: title, subject, due_date.
A2) Scheduled for 2025-09-05: title, subject, scheduled_block (NULL|number).
A3) Pool needing blocks today: COUNT where scheduled_date='2025-09-05' AND scheduled_block IS NULL.
Return CSV + totals. Do not modify.

Phase B ‚Äî API truth (READ-ONLY; include status + content-type):
B1) GET /api/assignments?date=2025-09-05&studentName=Khalil  ‚Üí list title,dueDate,scheduledDate,scheduledBlock.
B2) GET /api/schedule/Khalil/2025-09-05 ‚Üí blocks with titles.
Attach raw JSON.

Phase C ‚Äî UI mapping (READ-ONLY):
C1) Identify the render path (file:line). 
C2) Log ONLY (console.info) a table the UI uses to draw: 
   [{block, title, source: "dbScheduled"|"diversity"}].
Paste the console output.

Phase D ‚Äî DIFF (authoritative):
For blocks 2..N, show:
  DB (scheduled_block) | API (scheduledBlock) | UI (title,source)
Mark üî¥ where they differ and one-line reason (e.g., ‚Äúscheduler returned NULL‚Äù, ‚ÄúUI re-ordered‚Äù).

Phase E ‚Äî Determinism check:
- Re-run Phase A+B immediately (same session) and assert hashes of outputs match the first run.
- If different, report EXACT field that changed and which layer changed (DB/API/UI), with timestamps.
- Do NOT propose a fix; just state the minimal reproducible cause.

Acceptance for this run:
- Outputs include CODE+ENV+DB identifiers.
- A, B, C attached verbatim, plus DIFF table.
- Determinism check: A+B hashes identical across two runs (or a precise delta report).

If any rule would be violated, STOP and return which rule prevented action.
