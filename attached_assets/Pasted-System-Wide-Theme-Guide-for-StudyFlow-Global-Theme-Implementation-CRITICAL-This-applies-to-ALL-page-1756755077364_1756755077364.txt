System-Wide Theme Guide for StudyFlow
Global Theme Implementation
CRITICAL: This applies to ALL pages - Student Dashboard, Family Dashboard, Student Selection, Admin, and Guided Mode. Do NOT change any functionality, only colors via CSS variables.
Root CSS Variables Structure
Create a global theme system with these variable names that ALL components reference:
Core System Variables:

--color-background: Main app background
--color-surface: Cards and elevated elements
--color-surface-secondary: Slightly different surface for variation
--color-text: Primary text
--color-text-muted: Secondary/supporting text
--color-border: All borders and dividers

Brand Variables (same in both modes):

--color-primary: Rich purple (#844FC1 light, #A87DD1 dark)
--color-primary-soft: Purple at 10-20% opacity for backgrounds

Status Variables:

--color-success: Green for completion
--color-progress: Blue for active/in-progress
--color-support: Gray for needs-help/stuck
--color-warning: Yellow/amber for overtime (use sparingly)

Application Rules Across Pages
Student Selection Page:

Card backgrounds use Surface
Student avatars keep their assigned colors (Abigail purple, Khalil blue)
Hover states add 5% opacity backgrounds, never change text colors

Family Dashboard:

All cards use Surface color
Alert badges use Support color
Progress bars use Success when normal, Support when issues detected

Student Dashboard Overview:

Schedule blocks show status via icon colors only
Background remains clean Background color
Cards use Surface with subtle Border

Admin Pages:

Forms use Surface backgrounds
Input fields have Border color
Save buttons use Primary, Cancel uses Support

Print Styles:

Override all colors to black/white/grays for printing
Maintain layout and hierarchy through borders and spacing

Interaction States
Hover: Add 5% opacity background tint, never change text colors
Focus: Use Primary color at 20% opacity for focus rings
Disabled: Reduce opacity to 50%, don't change colors
Active/Pressed: Darken by 10% (light mode) or lighten by 10% (dark mode)
What Must Stay Consistent

Purple remains the primary brand color across both themes
Status colors (green/blue/gray) maintain their semantic meaning
All spacing, sizing, and layout remain unchanged
Font weights and sizes never change between themes
Animation timings stay identical
Shadow depths remain proportional

Testing Requirements
Toggle between light/dark modes and verify:

All text remains readable (WCAG AA contrast minimum)
Interactive elements are clearly visible
Status indicators maintain clear differentiation
No functionality is affected by theme changes
Print preview shows appropriate grayscale

The theme system should detect system preference but allow manual override via the moon/sun toggle button that's already present on all pages.
