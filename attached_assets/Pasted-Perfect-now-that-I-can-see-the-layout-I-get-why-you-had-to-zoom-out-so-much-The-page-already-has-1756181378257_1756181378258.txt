Perfect — now that I can see the layout, I get why you had to zoom out so much. The page already has a clean foundation, but the spacing, typography, and density could be adjusted to make it fit on one page while still feeling elegant and “Apple-like.” Here are targeted design suggestions:

⸻

🔠 Typography
	•	Limit font weights: Use Regular for body and Semibold for headings only. Right now, everything feels bold. This will reduce visual noise.
	•	Hierarchy tweaks:
	•	Task title → semibold, 16–18px
	•	Subtitle (e.g., “Daily Bible Reading”) → regular, 14px, muted gray
	•	Time and status → 13–14px, lighter gray

⸻

📏 Layout & Density
	•	Reduce vertical padding: Each card has too much breathing space. Shrink top/bottom padding by ~30%. This alone will let you fit more on the page.
	•	Compact cards: Instead of tall blocks, make them look like Apple Calendar or Reminders list items—flatter and tighter.
	•	Inline details: Place time + status on one line, right-aligned, instead of stacked. That cuts card height in half.

⸻

🎨 Visual Style
	•	Background: Keep page white, but soften cards with subtle borders (#E5E7EB) instead of heavy shadows.
	•	Accent color: Pick one (blue or green). Use it only for “current task” and progress highlights. Everything else stays grayscale.
	•	Icons: Make them smaller and lighter (muted gray stroke). Only use color for the “active” or special blocks (e.g., Movement = green icon).

⸻

📊 Progress & Focus
	•	Progress bar: Make it thinner (Apple Fitness-style), and consider replacing “0%” with a small circular badge that fills as they go.
	•	Highlight next task: Give the current or upcoming task a faint tinted background (e.g., soft blue fill). That keeps focus without extra clutter.

⸻

✨ Apple-like Touches
	•	Rounded corners: Keep them, but reduce to rounded-xl instead of very pill-like.
	•	Motion: Use subtle fades/slide-ins when switching views instead of static reloads.
	•	Consistency: Everything should align left, same spacing, no irregular gaps. Apple thrives on ruthless consistency.

🧩 Example of More Compact Task Row (pseudo-layout)

[Icon]  Bible — Daily Bible Reading
        9:00–9:20 AM       Not started

This format is flatter, saves vertical space, and looks closer to Apple’s Reminders or Calendar.

👉 If you want, I can draft a Tailwind/shadcn style adjustment snippet that you could drop into your task card component to compress the layout and give it that refined Apple feel.

Would you like me to write that out?
