Implementation Instructions

Create CSS variables for all colors - never hardcode hex values in components
The main card background should use the Surface color variable
Timer text must remain clearly visible - use Text Primary variable
Button colors: Done button uses Success color, Need More Time uses Progress color, Stuck uses Support color
Emergency Exit text starts with very low opacity Text Muted, becomes more visible on first click
Instructions panel uses slightly darker/lighter background than Surface (5% opacity difference)
Timer circle colors follow the same system: green for plenty of time, blue for focused time, gray for wrap-up time

Specific Elements
Main Focus Card: Use Surface color with subtle shadow using Primary color at 10% opacity
Current Task Title: Text Primary color, maintaining size and weight
Timer Display: Text Primary for numbers, Text Muted for "+X min" text
Action Buttons:

Done: Success color background, white text
Need More Time: Progress color border, Progress color text
Stuck: Support color border, Support color text

Instructions Box: Background at 5% opacity, maintaining all current padding and layout
Important: The TTS speaker icon for Khalil must remain visible - use Text Muted color
What NOT to Change

Do not modify button functionality or click handlers
Keep all timer logic intact
Preserve the double-click Emergency Exit mechanism
Maintain all spacing, padding, and layout
Keep font sizes and weights exactly as they are
Don't change any animation timings or transitions
Preserve all conditional rendering logic

The goal is simply to make colors respond to system dark/light mode preference while maintaining the exact same user experience and functionality.
