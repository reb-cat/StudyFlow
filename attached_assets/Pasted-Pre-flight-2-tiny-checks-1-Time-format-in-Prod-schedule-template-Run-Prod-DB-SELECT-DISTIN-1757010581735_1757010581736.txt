Pre-flight (2 tiny checks)
	1.	Time format in Prod schedule_template
	•	Run (Prod DB):
SELECT DISTINCT start_time, end_time FROM schedule_template WHERE student_name='Abigail' AND weekday='Thursday' ORDER BY start_time LIMIT 5;
	•	If you see HH:MM (e.g., 09:00) but your seed uses HH:MM:SS (e.g., 09:00:00), adjust the seed to use HH:MM or normalize in a migration.
	•	Your unique key {student_name, weekday, start_time, end_time} must use exact same strings or upserts won’t match.
	2.	Seed runner will actually execute in Prod
	•	Confirm it runs on startup in prod (your note says “no env gate; runs everywhere”).
	•	Make sure it logs a summary: inserted=…, skipped=… so you can prove it ran.

Deploy → What you should see (PROD artifacts you should collect)
	1.	Migration proof: 002_template_unique_key_and_parity applied.
	2.	Seed summary (PROD): expect inserted=10, skipped=0 the first time.
	•	If you still see inserted=0, skipped=10, it’s almost always the time format or casing/weekday label mismatch.
	3.	Template JSON (PROD):
GET /api/schedule-template/Abigail/Thursday → 10 blocks, with the real subjects and the HH:MM times you chose above.
	4.	Planner HAR (PROD):
POST /api/schedule/Abigail/<today>/initialize then GET /api/schedule/Abigail/<today> → 200 JSON with real subjects (not “Assignment”).
	5.	Planner metrics line:
tasks_total=…, due_today=…, filtered=…, scheduled=…, template_block_count=10, coop_day=false.
	6.	UI screenshot (PROD): /student/abigail showing Today’s Schedule populated with those subjects.

GO only if all six artifacts are from production and match the above.

⸻

Bible curriculum (why blank + the fix)
	•	Your scan already found: no official seed exists for bible_curriculum. That’s why Dev has data and Prod doesn’t.
	•	Add a small, idempotent seed (same pattern as templates):
	•	Unique key: whatever identifies a chapter/lesson uniquely (e.g., {course_id, unit, lesson_no} or {curriculum_id, day}).
	•	Seed uses upsert (insert if missing, skip if present).
	•	Log: bible_curriculum seed: inserted=…, skipped=….
	•	Acceptance (PROD): counts + a few sample rows, and a UI/API that consumes them showing non-empty data.

⸻

If the template seed “inserts 0” again
	•	Compare one dev row vs one prod row for Abigail/Thursday:
student_name, weekday, start_time, end_time, subject, block_type.
	•	Normalize time strings and labels (e.g., “Thursday” vs “Thu”; “Abigail” vs “abigail”).
	•	Re-run deploy; seed should flip to inserted > 0.
