Verify Database & TypeScript Fix Completeness - Full System Health Check
Please run a complete system verification to confirm all database issues are resolved and the system is production-ready. Check the following:
1. TypeScript Compilation Health

Run npx tsc --noEmit on entire codebase
Verify 0 TypeScript errors (was 9 errors in storage.ts)
Check for any type warnings or strict mode violations
Confirm all Canvas integration fields are properly typed

2. Database Query Performance

Test retrieval of all 106 assignments from PostgreSQL
Verify query response times are < 100ms
Check that Drizzle ORM queries aren't failing silently
Confirm no N+1 query problems

3. Assignment Retrieval Verification
sql-- Run these queries and verify counts:
-- Total: Should be 106 assignments
-- Abigail: 23 (13 completed, 10 pending)  
-- Khalil: 82
-- Demo: 1
4. API Endpoint Testing
Test each endpoint returns JSON (not HTML) with correct data:

GET /api/assignments (should return filtered results)
GET /api/assignments?userId=abigail-user (intelligent filtering active)
GET /api/assignments?userId=khalil-user
GET /api/students/abigail/assignments
Verify intelligent filtering removes duplicates/completed correctly

5. Auto-Restart Mechanism

Confirm tsx --watch is working
Make a test change to server/index.ts
Verify server auto-restarts within 2 seconds
Check no zombie processes accumulating

6. Schema Consistency Check

Compare Drizzle schema with actual PostgreSQL tables
Verify all nullable fields match between schema.ts and database
Check Canvas metadata fields (courseId, moduleId, etc.) are present
Confirm no orphaned or missing foreign key relationships

7. Error Handling Validation

Check for any try/catch blocks swallowing errors
Verify database connection errors are logged
Test behavior when DATABASE_URL is invalid
Confirm no "undefined is not assignable to null" runtime errors

8. Memory & Performance

Check for memory leaks in long-running queries
Verify database connection pooling is configured
Test with concurrent requests (10+ simultaneous)
Monitor for any timeout issues

Expected Results:
✅ 0 TypeScript errors
✅ All 106 assignments retrievable
✅ Intelligent filtering working (not a bug)
✅ Auto-restart functional
✅ < 100ms query times
✅ No silent failures
If any check fails, provide:

Exact error messages
Query that's failing
Expected vs actual behavior
Relevant log output

Question: Are there any edge cases or specific problematic queries we should test before declaring victory?
