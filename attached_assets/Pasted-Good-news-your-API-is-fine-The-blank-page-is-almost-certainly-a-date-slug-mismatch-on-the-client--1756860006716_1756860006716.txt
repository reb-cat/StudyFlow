Good news: your API is fine. The blank page is almost certainly a date/slug mismatch on the client, not bad data.

What your trace shows:
	•	You’re on /student/abigail and the UI header says Tuesday, Sept 2, 2025.
	•	The client fetched /api/assignments?date=2025-09-03&studentName=Abigail and got a full list (many with scheduledDate: "2025-09-03").
	•	Your UI then logged 2025-09-02 [] — meaning it filtered for 09-02 while the fetch returned 09-03 → empty → blank.

Why this happens
	1.	Off-by-one day from UTC: using new Date().toISOString().slice(0,10) gives the UTC date, which can differ from the user’s local day.
	2.	Filter vs query mismatch: your list filters on selectedDate (09-02) while you queried the API for 09-03.
	3.	Name vs slug: path is /student/abigail but you query with studentName=Abigail. That’s fine now (API returned data), but it’s brittle—use a slug/id consistently.

Surgical fixes

1) Make “today” use local date (no UTC shift)

Replace any “today” string like this:

// before (UTC-based)
const today = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10);

with:

export function toLocalISODate(d = new Date()) {
  const offMs = d.getTimezoneOffset() * 60_000;
  return new Date(d.getTime() - offMs).toISOString().slice(0, 10);
}
// usage
const today = toLocalISODate();

2) Keep the fetch date and the filter date in lockstep

Where you load assignments, derive a single selectedDate and use it for both the request and the client-side filter:

const [selectedDate, setSelectedDate] = useState(toLocalISODate());

useEffect(() => {
  apiFetch(`/api/assignments?date=${selectedDate}&studentSlug=${slug}`, { credentials: 'include' })
    .then(r => r.json())
    .then(setAssignments)
    .catch(() => setAssignments([]));
}, [selectedDate, slug]);

// When rendering:
const dayItems = assignments.filter(a => a.scheduledDate === selectedDate);

3) Use slug (or id) instead of free-text name
	•	Change the client query to studentSlug=${slug} (from useParams()).
	•	On the server, accept studentSlug (and optionally fallback to case-insensitive name as a shim).

// server
app.get('/api/assignments', requireAuth, async (req, res) => {
  const { date, studentSlug, studentName } = req.query as any;
  const ownerId = req.user.id;

  const student =
    (studentSlug && await bySlug(ownerId, studentSlug)) ||
    (studentName && await byName(ownerId, studentName)) ||
    null;

  if (!student) return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Student not found' });

  // fetch assignments for `date` and this student.id…
});

4) Don’t let the page go blank on empty/error

Guard your component:

if (loading)  return <div>Loading…</div>;
if (error)    return <div style={{padding:16}}>Couldn’t load this student.</div>;
if (!dayItems.length) return <div style={{padding:16}}>No items for {selectedDate}.</div>;

Quick confirmation (2 checks)
	•	In DevTools → Console, log both:

console.log('selectedDate', selectedDate);              // should equal the query date
console.log('firstItemDate', assignments[0]?.scheduledDate);


	•	Use the date toggle in your UI to switch to 2025-09-03; the list should populate immediately.

Optional cleanups (nice to have)
	•	Backfill a slug column for students and make (owner_id, slug) unique so URLs are stable.
	•	On the server, normalize scheduledDate creation to the same local date logic (or to UTC midnight but then always convert on the client).

If you want, paste the tiny snippet where you compute “today” and where you build the assignments URL—I’ll rewrite that block so it can’t drift again.
