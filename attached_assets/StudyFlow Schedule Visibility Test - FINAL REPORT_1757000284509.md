# StudyFlow Schedule Visibility Test - FINAL REPORT

## VERDICT: **NO-GO** ❌

**Critical Issue Found**: Schedule planner produces 0 items despite multiple assignments being due today.

---

## Executive Summary
Testing on the production environment https://study-flow.replit.app has revealed a critical scheduling system failure. While the API infrastructure is functional and assignments exist in the system, the schedule planner is not generating any scheduled items for students, making the core scheduling functionality non-operational.

## Test Environment Details
- **Production URL**: https://study-flow.replit.app
- **Test Date**: September 4, 2025
- **Student Tested**: Abigail (/student/abigail)
- **Browser**: Fresh session with DevTools configured

## Phase-by-Phase Results

### Phase 1: Pre-checks ✅
- **Current ISO Date**: 2025-09-04T15:13:56.738Z
- **Timezone**: UTC
- **Student URL**: /student/abigail
- **UI Today Date**: Thursday, September 4, 2025
- **API Endpoints**: All 4 required endpoints returning 200 status with JSON

### Phase 2: Task Creation ⚠️
- **Approach**: Used existing assignments due today instead of creating new ones
- **Reason**: Assignment creation form access issues
- **Available Assignments**: 5 assignments due today at 1:15 PM

### Phase 3: Schedule Regeneration ❌
- **Initialize API**: ✅ 200 status, successful response
- **Schedule API after init**: ✅ 200 status, but **EMPTY array []**
- **Critical Finding**: Schedule remains empty despite successful initialization

### Phase 4: Date and Filter Isolation ❌
- **Yesterday (2025-09-03)**: 0 scheduled items
- **Today (2025-09-04)**: 0 scheduled items  
- **Tomorrow (2025-09-05)**: 0 scheduled items
- **Co-op Day Status**: Active (green toggle)
- **Filter States**: Neither Overview nor Guided buttons active
- **Co-op Day Toggle Test**: No change in schedule after toggling

### Phase 5: Assignment vs Schedule Consistency ❌
- **Assignments Available**: 10 total assignments found
- **Assignments Due Today**: 5 assignments due Sep 4, 2025 at 13:15:00.000Z
- **Schedule Items**: 0 items
- **Critical Issue**: **Planner produced 0 items despite available assignments**

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue is **NOT** with:
- ✅ API infrastructure (all endpoints working)
- ✅ Authentication (session active)
- ✅ Assignment data (assignments exist and are properly dated)
- ✅ Network connectivity
- ✅ Database access

The issue **IS** with:
- ❌ **Schedule planning algorithm** - Not converting available assignments into scheduled items
- ❌ **Date filtering logic** - May be incorrectly filtering out today's assignments
- ❌ **Co-op Day logic** - May be preventing scheduling on Co-op Days
- ❌ **Assignment eligibility rules** - May be too restrictive

---

## Server-Side Logging Request

**URGENT**: Backend team needs to add logging for the planner run with these counts:

```
planner=run student=abigail date=2025-09-04 tz=UTC
tasks_total=10 due_today=5 filtered=? scheduled=0
```

**Required Log Details**:
- Total tasks for student: **10**
- Tasks due today (local window): **5**
- Tasks filtered out by rules: **UNKNOWN - NEEDS LOGGING**
- Final scheduled items count: **0**

---

## Impact Assessment

**Severity**: **CRITICAL** - Core functionality failure
**User Impact**: Students cannot see their daily schedules
**Business Impact**: Primary application feature non-functional

---

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Enable detailed planner logging** to identify filtering rules
2. **Review Co-op Day scheduling logic** - may be blocking all scheduling
3. **Audit assignment eligibility criteria** - may be too restrictive
4. **Test date/time zone handling** - assignments may be filtered incorrectly
5. **Verify schedule template configuration** - may be missing or misconfigured

---

## Evidence Artifacts

- **HAR File**: Network traffic showing API calls and responses
- **Console Logs**: Detailed API testing results
- **Screenshots**: Empty schedule interface
- **Assignment Data**: JSON showing available assignments
- **API Responses**: All endpoints returning expected data structure

---

## Conclusion

The StudyFlow scheduling system has a critical failure in the planning algorithm. While all supporting infrastructure is functional, the core feature of generating daily schedules is completely non-operational. This represents a **NO-GO** situation requiring immediate investigation and resolution before the system can be considered functional for student use.

**Next Steps**: Backend team must implement detailed logging and investigate the schedule planning logic to identify why assignments are not being converted to scheduled items.
